## Troubelshouting

When you launch the game for the first time, it will try to connect to the server. It can take a few miutes.


If you interrupted it while connecting to the server, it may be unable to reconnect it the next time you launch the game.


You can delete the `Steam` repository in you game location. Do not delete this repository if you already saved a game, you could lose it.
